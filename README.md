Commands
----------
### j add, j +

Adds the current working directory as a bookmark.

```bash
aguo@unix5:~/Documents/10605$ j add
Type an alias for "cd /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr9/aguo/Documents/10605 && pwd && ls", or ^C to quit:
ml
"ml" added as an alias.
```

### j add <alias>

Creates an alias for a command.

```bash
aguo@unix5:~$ j add bics
Type a command for "bics", or ^C to quit:
telnet alexbug.com 5000
"bics" added as an alias.
```

### j del, j -, j del \<bookmark\>, j - \<bookmark\>

(Thanks to Mr Green for conceiving the idea and writing code for this!).

Delete a bookmark.

```

```bash
$ j - fics

### j find

alias bics="telnet alexbug.com 4000" # Generated by JARVIS
```

### j edit, j vim

We would like help with...
---------------------------
- Updating our wiki: https://github.com/mallochine/jarvis2/wiki/jrc---Documentation
- Getting JARVIS2 into the packagement systems of various Linux distributions,
such as apt-get (ubuntu), pacman (archlinux), and more!
- Any suggestions to make jarvis2 even simpler.
