JARVIS 2.0
----------

EDIT: I recently added a whole bunch of new functionality, but I realized that
people really liked the original version of JARVIS 2, which kept things
extremely simple -- just add a bookmark, and \<boom\>, you're done.
So I reverted JARVIS 2 to its original version, and put all the new
functionality in JARVIS 3.

What's new in JARVIS 2.0 is filesystem navigation through _user-input_,
instead of a machine trying to learn how the user behaves. As it turns out, it's a
very natural habit for users to create bookmarks, while it is very _unnatural_ to wait
for a machine to catch up to you. JARVIS 2.0 is a prototype for this "naturalness"
thesis.


Installation

Download the whole git repo (git clone https://github.com/mallochine/jarvis2.git).
Run the command that corresponds to your shell:

- make bash 
- make zsh 

```bash
]$ git clone https://github.com/mallochine/jarvis4

$ cd jarvis4
$ make bash
mkdir ~/.jarvis_config
cp jarvis ~/.jarvis_config/jarvis
echo . ~/.jarvis_config/jarvis >> ~/.bashrc;
echo "Restart your shell"
Restart your shell
```

Getting Started
-----------------

There are only a few commands you need to know in order to get started.

Use the "j add" to create a bookmark for the directory you are currently in.

Use thE "j add <alias>" to create an alias for a command.

Commands
----------
### j add, j +

Adds the current working directory as a bookmark.

```bash
aguo@unix5:~/Documents/10605$ j add
Type an alias for "cd /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr9/aguo/Documents/10605 && pwd && ls", or ^C to quit:
ml
"ml" added as an alias.
```

### j add <alias>

Creates an alias for a command.

```bash
aguo@unix5:~$ j add bics
Type a command for "bics", or ^C to quit:
telnet alexbug.com 5000
"bics" added as an alias.
```

### j del, j -, j del \<bookmark\>, j - \<bookmark\>

(Thanks to Mr Green for conceiving the idea and writing code for this!).

Delete a bookmark.

```bash
$ j -
Type an alias you wish to delete, or ^C to quit:
fics
"fics" deleted.
```

```bash
$ j - fics
"fics" deleted.
```

### j find

Greps the bookmarks for a given query. If a query is given, then jarvis
greps "\<query\>". Otherwise, jarvis will grep using $PWD.

```bash
$ j find bics
alias bics="telnet alexbug.com 4000" # Generated by JARVIS
```

### j edit, j vim

Edits your bookmarks using your shell's default editor (kudos to Mr Green for
writing this!).

```bash
$ j edit
```

```bash
  1 alias j="jarvis" # Generated by JARVIS
  2 alias bics="telnet alexbug.com 4000" # Generated by JARVIS
~
~
~
~

```

### j all

Lists all the bookmarks you have.

```bash
$ j all
alias j="jarvis" # Generated by JARVIS
alias bics="telnet alexbug.com 4000" # Generated by JARVIS
```

### j help

Displays help info.

```bash
Usage: j [CMD] <file or dir> <bookmark>

Commands
  add | +   Add a bookmark
  del | -   Delete a bookmark
  all       List all bookmarks
  help      Print this help message
```

We would like help with...
---------------------------
- Updating our wiki: https://github.com/mallochine/jarvis2/wiki/jrc---Documentation
- Getting JARVIS2 into the packagement systems of various Linux distributions,
such as apt-get (ubuntu), pacman (archlinux), and more!
- Any suggestions to make jarvis2 even simpler.
